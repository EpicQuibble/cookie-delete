Made this because I found myself constantly having to refresh the cookies of a website I was testing. 
Couldn't find an extension that did what I wanted. So now this exists 
ONLY deletes the cookies for the domain you are on
EX: cookies set for github.com while you are on github.com will be deleted, NOT Google.com cookies
